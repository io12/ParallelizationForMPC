abstract = {The classic textbook for computer systems analysis and design, Computer Organization and Design, has been thoroughly updated to provide a new focus on the revolutionary change taking place in industry today: the switch from uniprocessor to multicore microprocessors. This new emphasis on parallelism is supported by updates reflecting the newest technologies with examples highlighting the latest processor designs, benchmarking standards, languages and tools. As with previous editions, a MIPS processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. Along with its increased coverage of parallelism, this new edition offers new content on Flash memory and virtual machines as well as a new and important appendix written by industry experts covering the emergence and importance of the modern GPU (graphics processing unit), the highly parallel, highly multithreaded multiprocessor optimized for visual computing.A new exercise paradigm allows instructors to reconfigure the 600 exercises included in the book to easily generate new exercises and solutions of their own. A CD provides a toolkit of simulators and compilers along with tutorials for using them as well as additional problems and solutions, and references.}

  abstract = {Secure computation enables mutually distrusting parties to jointly evaluate a function on their private inputs without revealing anything but the function's output. Generic secure computation protocols in the semi-honest model have been studied extensively and several best practices have evolved.\\
        In this work, we design and implement a mixed-protocol framework, called \emph{ABY}, that efficiently combines secure computation schemes based on \underline{A}rithmetic sharing, \underline{B}oolean sharing, and \underline{Y}ao's garbled circuits and that makes available best practice solutions in secure two-party computation. Our framework allows to pre-compute almost all cryptographic operations and provides novel, highly efficient conversions between secure computation schemes based on pre-computed oblivious transfer extensions. ABY supports several standard operations and we perform benchmarks on a local network and in a public intercontinental cloud. From our benchmarks we deduce new insights on the efficient design of secure computation protocols, most prominently that oblivious transfer-based multiplications are much more efficient than multiplications based on homomorphic encryption. We use ABY to construct mixed-protocols for three example applications -- private set intersection, biometric matching, and modular exponentiation -- and show that they are more efficient than using a single protocol.},

Interestingly, we first show that a straightforward relaxation of standard security notions for encryption such as indistinguishability against chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is unachievable by a practical OPE scheme. Instead, we propose a security notion in the spirit of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and related primitives asking that an OPE scheme look ``as-random-as-possible'' subject to the order-preserving constraint. We then design an efficient OPE scheme and prove its security under our notion based on pseudorandomness of an underlying blockcipher. Our construction is based on a natural relation we uncover between a random order-preserving function and the hypergeometric probability distribution. In particular, it makes black-box use of an efficient sampling algorithm for the latter.",

abstract="We further the study of order-preserving symmetric encryption (OPE), a primitive for allowing efficient range queries on encrypted data, recently initiated (from a cryptographic perspective) by Boldyreva et al. (Eurocrypt '09). First, we address the open problem of characterizing what encryption via a random order-preserving function (ROPF) leaks about underlying data (ROPF being the ``ideal object'' in the security definition, POPF, satisfied by their scheme.) In particular, we show that, for a database of randomly distributed plaintexts and appropriate choice of parameters, ROPF encryption leaks neither the precise value of any plaintext nor the precise distance between any two of them. The analysis here is quite technically non-trivial and introduces useful new techniques. On the other hand, we also show that ROPF encryption does leak both the value of any plaintext as well as the distance between any two plaintexts to within a range of possibilities roughly the square root of the domain size. We then study schemes that are not order-preserving, but which nevertheless allow efficient range queries and achieve security notions stronger than POPF. In a setting where the entire database is known in advance of key-generation (considered in several prior works), we show that recent constructions of ``monotone minimal perfect hash functions'' allow to efficiently achieve (an adaptation of) the notion of IND-O(rdered) CPA also considered by Boldyreva et al., which asks that only the order relations among the plaintexts is leaked. Finally, we introduce modular order-preserving encryption (MOPE), in which the scheme of Boldyreva et al. is prepended with a shift cipher. MOPE improves the security of OPE in a sense, as it does not leak any information about plaintext location. We clarify that our work should not be interpreted as saying the original scheme of Boldyreva et al., or the variants that we introduce, are ``secure'' or ``insecure.'' Rather, the goal of this line of research is to help practitioners decide whether the options provide a suitable security-functionality tradeoff for a given application.",

abstract = {Divide-and-conquer is a common parallel programming skeleton supported by many cross-platform multithreaded libraries, and most commonly used by programmers for parallelization. The challenges of producing (manually or automatically) a correct divide-and-conquer parallel program from a given sequential code are two-fold: (1) assuming that a good solution exists where individual worker threads execute a code identical to the sequential one, the programmer has to provide the extra code for dividing the tasks and combining the partial results (i.e. joins), and (2) the sequential code may not be suitable for divide-and-conquer parallelization as is, and may need to be modified to become a part of a good solution. We address both challenges in this paper. We present an automated synthesis technique to synthesize correct joins and an algorithm for modifying the sequential code to make it suitable for parallelization when necessary. This paper focuses on class of loops that traverse a read-only collection and compute a scalar function over that collection. We present theoretical results for when the necessary modifications to sequential code are possible, theoretical guarantees for the algorithmic solutions presented here, and experimental evaluation of the approach's success in practice and the quality of the produced parallel programs.},

abstract = {Secure two-party computation allows two untrusting parties to jointly compute an arbitrary function on their respective private inputs while revealing no information beyond the outcome. Existing cryptographic compilers can automatically generate secure computation protocols from high-level specifications, but are often limited in their use and efficiency of generated protocols as they are based on either garbled circuits or (additively) homomorphic encryption only.In this paper we present TASTY, a novel tool for automating, i.e., describing, generating, executing, benchmarking, and comparing, efficient secure two-party computation protocols. TASTY is a new compiler that can generate protocols based on homomorphic encryption and efficient garbled circuits as well as combinations of both, which often yields the most efficient protocols available today. The user provides a high-level description of the computations to be performed on encrypted data in a domain-specific language. This is automatically transformed into a protocol. TASTY provides most recent techniques and optimizations for practical secure two-party computation with low online latency. Moreover, it allows to efficiently evaluate circuits generated by the well-known Fairplay compiler.We use TASTY to compare protocols for secure multiplication based on homomorphic encryption with those based on garbled circuits and highly efficient Karatsuba multiplication. Further, we show how TASTY improves the online latency for securely evaluating the AES functionality by an order of magnitude compared to previous software implementations. TASTY allows to automatically generate efficient secure protocols for many privacy-preserving applications where we consider the use cases for private set intersection and face recognition protocols.},

When L = 2 we obtain a classical form of MPC protocol in which interaction is required for multiplications, as L increases interaction is reduced, in that one requires interaction only after computing a higher degree function. When L approaches infinity one obtains the FHE based protocol of Gentry, which requires no interaction. Thus one can trade communication for computation in a simple way. Our protocol is based on an interactive protocol for ``bootstrapping'' a somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) scheme. The key contribution is that our presented protocol is highly communication efficient enabling us to obtain reduced communication when compared to traditional MPC protocols for relatively small values of L.",

abstract = {The practical application of Secure Two-Party Computation is hindered by the difficulty to implement secure computation protocols. While recent work has proposed very simple programming languages which can be used to specify secure computations, it is still difficult for practitioners to use them, and cumbersome to translate existing source code into this format. Similarly, the manual construction of two-party computation protocols, in particular ones based on the approach of garbled circuits, is labor intensive and error-prone.The central contribution of the current paper is a tool which achieves Secure Two-Party Computation for ANSI C. Our work is based on a combination of model checking techniques and two-party computation based on garbled circuits. Our key insight is a nonstandard use of the bit-precise model checker CBMC which enables us to translate C programs into equivalent Boolean circuits. To this end, we modify the standard CBMC translation from programs into Boolean formulas whose variables correspond to the memory bits manipulated by the program. As CBMC attempts to minimize the size of the formulas, the circuits obtained by our tool chain are also size efficient; to improve the efficiency of the garbled circuit evaluation, we perform optimizations on the circuits. Experimental results with the new tool CBMC-GC demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach.},

abstract = {The concept of homomorphic encryption was introduced almost exactly same time as the first public-key cryptographic algorithm RSA, which was multiplicatively homomorphic. Encryption functions with additive and multiplicative homomorphisms allow us (at least in principle) to compute any function homomorphically, and thus are highly desired. Such encryption functions have applications in healthcare, machine learning and national security. Since the work of Craig Gentry [1], there have been several fully homomorphic encryption proposals, however, their time and space requirements do not give way to acceptably efficient implementations in real-world scenarios. The challenge comes from the fact that, while the encryption, decryption and homomorphic operations are simple arithmetic operations (such as polynomial addition and multiplication), the sizes of operands are beyond the usual operand sizes we have been used to in the standard public-key cryptography. For example, the polynomial operands (representing ciphertexts) used in the BGV algorithm [2] are supposed to have up to 16k terms, with each term up to 1k bits. About 1024-bit message is encrypted into one ciphertext that requires several million bits. In this talk, I will present some of formidable algorithmic and architectural challenges facing FHE implementors.},
